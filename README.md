# Wilab plus
An improved system and link level simulator for ISAC and 5G NR Sidelink positioning.

We are uploading the simulator...some supporting documents could be found in the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/V2Xgithub/WiLabV2Xsim/wiki) and others may not be updated...
For Octave compatible version, please see branch ***Octave-version***

***WiLabV2Xsim*** is a dynamic simulator, written in MATLAB, overhauling LTEV2Vsim (see https://github.com/alessandrobazzi/LTEV2Vsim) to support sidelink 5G-V2X. 
It is designed for the investigation of resource allocation in networks based on ***sidelink C-V2X***, with focus on the cooperative awareness service, but it also allows to simulate ***IEEE 802.11p/ITS-G5***.

The simulator is shared under the GNU GPLv3. The software has been developed and shared by University of Bologna, CNR, and WiLab/CNIT - Italy. 

The first release of this simulator is version 6.1 to remark the continuity with LTEV2Xsim, of which the last shared version was 5.4.

From version 5.4 to version 6.1 the main modification is the addition of 5G-V2X, with NR and all the related settings (including numerology). A general refactoring was performed to generalize the parameters which are common for LTE and 5G, now indicated as CV2X. Minor corrections and improvements were also performed. 

NOTICE: The code runs correctly with Matlab versions from 2021b at least.
There are problems with version 2016b and earlier. With the versions in between, some minor corrections would be required (we haven't checked all the versions).
The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™ is needed for the simulation and generation of 3GPP a-periodic traffic.

Sidelink定位模块：based on https://github.com/Group85GP/Group85GP/tree/5G-positioning-simulator/.

运行simulation.m , 在mainV2X.m中每个TTI结束mainCV2XttiEnds后进行sidelink定位，定位函数模块：MainFiles\mainV2XSidelinkPosition.m 
其中函数pf.plotSysLayout绘制系统布局图。函数pf.plotCDF绘制累积分布函数(CDF)图。LocErrall为定位误差
