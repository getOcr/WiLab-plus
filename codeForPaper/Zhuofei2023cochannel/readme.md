# Code Explanation
This folder is organized for plot figures mentioned in the following paper:

    Wu, Z., Bartoletti, S., Martinez, V., Todisco, V., & Bazzi, A. (2023). Analysis of Co-Channel Coexistence Mitigation Methods Applied to IEEE 802.11 p and 5G NR-V2X Sidelink. Sensors, 23(9), 4337.

## 1. Simulation
Simulation code and related configeration files could be found in folder "simulation_task". In order to get smooth curves, more simulations for each scenario maybe needed.

The simulation results would be saved in folder "data/[subfolders]"

## 2. Read data and plot
In folder "plot_figs_for_paper", "read_tot_data.m" and "plot_tot_data.m" could be modified to use the other functions to read and plot related figures.

Figures would be saved in folder "figures".
